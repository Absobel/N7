bossfight : next month lvl 15 boss

Two items : strategy / repartition of equipment
- have informations
- will reaveal informations about important information during meeting

Boss : Kobold Lord, big strong imposing gobling who has many abilities that are listed on document
Presentation of map
Boss isen't alone, he has manu henchmen, weacker than him, but there are many

Chair has thought of strategies to discuss :
- very offensive | try to kill him as fast as possible
- Sneaky attack
- step by step attack, kill one by one all henchmen, fught longer but easier

Absobel : sneaky attack can't be bc previous lvl
Olivier : put people outside of trigger zone
Absobel : but henchmen --> third strat
Alan : not for sneaky attack as well
Olivier : not sure offsenive attack cause boss is strong, boss is fast and would do more damage than heal, might be able do escape or overwhelm us

Chair forgot to mention : if defeat boss all henchmen disappear
Strategy : kill all henchemn so that concentrate on boss
Absobel : have lot of high damage spells concentrate on the boss if henchmen killed
Nino : weakness ?
Absobel : vulnerable between spells
Ninoi : and alan : powers ?
Alan : Bow and heal long range

Nino : not too much atacck but defense and can protect people

Vote  on strat : unanimity third strat
alan suggestion : occupying the boss with defensive members so that offensive can stop the boss by cutting legs
Nino : asks to olivier if it's possible if his protected
Olivier : yes but only if no minions
Nino asks me too

Nino give role of two others members : tank and offesive role single longer sword
Strat : split the team in half : one group on the boss and the other on the minions


Another item on agenda : repartition of equipment
equipment very pricy so use it very preciously (don't have a lot)
equipment : 3 health potion, enchanted fairy (when you die regenerate you with a small amount of hp) (don't give it to someone dying in front of you bc precious), the last chance shield (deflect all damage one time), enchanted apple (notch apple) when eaten it gives a lot of damage boost and speed boost.

Olivier and Absobel : give last chance shield to ppl defending ppl from the boss
Alan : healing potion for him since healer
Olivier : ehcnated fairy for healer since if he dies bof
Nino : easier to run away since he's not in the fight already
Nino : echanted apple effect 30s, run attack who has it, but question is when using it ?
Alan : emergency item
Olivier : interesting as last resort but would help to optimize or offensive bc reduce mobility of boss can't deflect our attacks, maybe give to Absobel bc great attack that can't avoid
Absobel : yes useful to me
Nino : and emergency or strategy use ?
Absobel : depends in all goes according to plan

health position : tswo boss group, one in hechman
Echanted fairy : alan
enchanted apple : Absobel
Last chance shield : tank

Olivier : potion should go to defensive members
Alan : potions give percentage of potion
ok

Summary : attack strategy : two important step
- attack the boss reduce mobility
- reduce hp and dealing with minions
Sharing the equipment :
- Shiled and apple : offesenvie members
- Fairy : defensive members : alan
- Potions shared equaly
Use apple if we have to regain advantage in the fight

Final questions :
Olivier : risk guild tries to attack boss before us or steal victory from us
Nino : protected during fight but they could attack us after victory with all important items
Nino : that's why meeting secret
Alan : do we know loot of boss ?
Nino : no bc first time dealing with this boss

Next meeting : next week
Everyone : available
Nino : thans to everyonr and hope we will win this fight.
