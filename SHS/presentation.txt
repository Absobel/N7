So hello, I'm Absobel, and I'm currently studying computer science at N7.

I am passionate about computer science since my childhood when I was introduced to my first programming language. Since then I followed the education that would lead me to work in this field. So I chose a science focused baccalaur√©at and went into prepschool with the goal of becoming an engineer. During all this time I of course continued to program in my free time, I made games and other personal projects. I also participated in maths related activities, since math are an integral part of compiter science. During highschool I competed in the maths olympiad (I got the 16th place in my region), I was also part of the group math and jeans in which we had to solve in groups one or two exercices and then presents them to an audience in a national convention at the end of the year.

So, for the future I mainly plan to get my computer science degree. To be more accurate I want, in my second year, to take the AI major. I firmly think that AI is the future and that this field will be one of the most important in the near future. There's also the fact that if I choose this major, I will work every other month in a company. So not only I will be paid, but I will also gain invaluable first hand experience that will be useful for the rest of my professional life. It will also allow me to be pretty much already hired before the end of my studies and it will probably assure that I will often quickly find a new job if I happen to be let go.

So in conclusion I guess I can say that I have known that I wanted to work in computer science for a long time but the more my studies continue the more my plans get detailled.
